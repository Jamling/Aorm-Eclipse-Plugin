<dl class="attr">
<dt><a name="embedded"></a><code>android:allowEmbedded</code></dt>
<dd>
    Indicate that the activity can be launched as the embedded child of another
    activity. Particularly in the case where the child lives in a container
    such as a Display owned by another activity. For example, activities
    that are used for Wear custom notifications must declare this so
    Wear can display the activity in it's context stream, which resides
    in another process.

    <p>The default value of this attribute is <code>false</code>.
</p></dd>
<dt><a name="reparent"></a><code>android:allowTaskReparenting</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity can move from the task that started it to
the task it has an affinity for when that task is next brought to the
front — "<code>true</code>" if it can move, and "<code>false</code>" if it
must remain with the task where it started.

<p>
If this attribute is not set, the value set by the corresponding
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
attribute of the <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element
applies to the activity.  The default value is "<code>false</code>".
</p>

<p>
Normally when an activity is started, it's associated with the task of
the activity that started it and it stays there for its entire lifetime.
You can use this attribute to force it to be re-parented to the task it
has an affinity for when its current task is no longer displayed.
Typically, it's used to cause the activities of an application to move
to the main task associated with that application.
</p>

<p>
For example, if an e-mail message contains a link to a web page, clicking
the link brings up an activity that can display the page.  That activity
is defined by the browser application, but is launched as part of the e-mail
task.  If it's reparented to the browser task, it will be shown when the
browser next comes to the front, and will be absent when the e-mail task
again comes forward.
</p>

<p>
The affinity of an activity is defined by the
<code><a href="#aff">taskAffinity</a></code> attribute.  The affinity
of a task is determined by reading the affinity of its root activity.
Therefore, by definition, a root activity is always in a task with the
same affinity.  Since activities with "<code>singleTask</code>" or
"<code>singleInstance</code>" launch modes can only be at the root of a task,
re-parenting is limited to the "<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>"
modes.  (See also the <code><a href="#lmode">launchMode</a></code>
attribute.)
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="always"></a><code>android:alwaysRetainTaskState</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not the state of the task that the activity is in will always
be maintained by the system — "<code>true</code>" if it will be, and
"<code>false</code>" if the system is allowed to reset the task to its initial
state in certain situations.  The default value is "<code>false</code>".  This
attribute is meaningful only for the root activity of a task; it's ignored
for all other activities.

<p>
Normally, the system clears a task (removes all activities from the stack
above the root activity) in certain situations when the user re-selects that
task from the home screen.  Typically, this is done if the user hasn't visited
the task for a certain amount of time, such as 30 minutes.
</p>

<p>
However, when this attribute is "<code>true</code>", users will always return
to the task in its last state, regardless of how they get there.  This is
useful, for example, in an application like the web browser where there is
a lot of state (such as multiple open tabs) that users would not like to lose.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="autoremrecents"></a><code>android:autoRemoveFromRecents</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not tasks launched by activities with this attribute remains in the
<a href="/guide/components/recents.html">overview screen</a> until the last activity in the
task is completed. If <code>true</code>, the task is
automatically removed from the overview screen. This overrides the caller's use of
<code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_RETAIN_IN_RECENTS">FLAG_ACTIVITY_RETAIN_IN_RECENTS</a></code>. It must be a boolean value, either
"<code>true</code>" or "<code>false</code>".</dd>


<dt><a name="banner"></a><code>android:banner</code></dt>
<dd>A <a href="/guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.html">drawable resource</a>
providing an extended graphical banner for its associated item. Use with the
<code>&lt;activity&gt;</code> tag to supply a default banner for a specific activity, or with the
<a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html"><code>&lt;application&gt;</code></a>
tag to supply a banner for all application activities.

<p>The system uses the banner to represent an app in
the Android TV home screen. Since the banner is displayed only in the home screen, it
should only be specified by applications with an activity that handles the
<code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER">CATEGORY_LEANBACK_LAUNCHER</a></code> intent.</p>

<p>This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image (for example <code>"@drawable/banner"</code>). There is no default banner.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="/design/tv/patterns.html#banner">
Banners</a> in the UI Patterns for TV design guide, and <a href="/training/tv/start/start.html#banner">
Provide a home screen banner</a> in Get Started with TV Apps for more information.
</p></dd>


<dt><a name="clear"></a><code>android:clearTaskOnLaunch</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not all activities will be removed from the task, except for
the root activity, whenever it is re-launched from the home screen —
"<code>true</code>" if the task is always stripped down to its root activity, and
"<code>false</code>" if not.  The default value is "<code>false</code>".  This attribute
is meaningful only for activities that start a new task (the root activity);
it's ignored for all other activities in the task.

<p>
When the value is "<code>true</code>", every time users start the task again, they
are brought to its root activity regardless of what they were last doing in
the task and regardless of whether they used the <em>Back</em> or <em>Home</em> button to
leave it. When the value is "<code>false</code>", the task may be cleared of activities in
some situations (see the
<code><a href="#always">alwaysRetainTaskState</a></code> attribute), but not always.
</p>

<p>
Suppose, for example, that someone launches activity P from the home screen,
and from there goes to activity Q.  The user next presses <em>Home</em>, and then returns
to activity P.  Normally, the user would see activity Q, since that is what they
were last doing in P's task.  However, if P set this flag to "<code>true</code>", all
of the activities on top of it (Q in this case) were removed when the user pressed
<em>Home</em> and the task went to the background.  So the user sees only P when returning
to the task.
</p>

<p>
If this attribute and <code><a href="#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
are both "<code>true</code>", any activities that can be re-parented are moved to
the task they share an affinity with; the remaining activities are then dropped,
as described above.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="config"></a><code>android:configChanges</code></dt>
<dd>Lists configuration changes that the activity will handle itself.  When a configuration
change occurs at runtime, the activity is shut down and restarted by default, but declaring a
configuration with this attribute will prevent the activity from being restarted. Instead, the
activity remains running and its <code><code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onConfigurationChanged(android.content.res.Configuration)">onConfigurationChanged()</a></code></code> method is called.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Using this attribute should be
avoided and used only as a last resort. Please read <a href="/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html">Handling Runtime Changes</a> for more
information about how to properly handle a restart due to a configuration change.</p>

Any or all of the following strings are valid values for this attribute. Multiple values are

is "<code>true</code>".

<p>
The <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a>

<a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#enabled">enabled</a></code>
attribute that applies to all application components, including activities.  The
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
and <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code> attributes must both be "<code>true</code>" (as they both
are by default) for the system to be able to instantiate the activity.  If either
is "<code>false</code>", it cannot be instantiated.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="exclude"></a><code>android:excludeFromRecents</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not the task initiated by this activity should be excluded from the list of recently
used applications, the <a href="/guide/components/recents.html">
overview screen</a>. That is, when this activity is the root activity of a new
task, this attribute determines whether the task should not appear in the list of recent apps. Set
"<code>true</code>" if the task should be <em>excluded</em> from the list; set "<code>false</code>" if it
should be <em>included</em>. The default value is "<code>false</code>".
<p></p></dd>

<dt><a name="exported"></a><code>android:exported</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity can be launched by components of other
applications — "<code>true</code>" if it can be, and "<code>false</code>" if not.
If "<code>false</code>", the activity can be launched only by components of the
same application or applications with the same user ID.

<p>
The default value depends on whether the activity contains intent filters.  The
absence of any filters means that the activity can be invoked only by specifying
its exact class name.  This implies that the activity is intended only for
application-internal use (since others would not know the class name).  So in
this case, the default value is "<code>false</code>".
On the other hand, the presence of at least one filter implies that the activity
is intended for external use, so the default value is "<code>true</code>".
</p>

<p>
This attribute is not the only way to limit an activity's exposure to other
applications.  You can also use a permission to limit the external entities that
can invoke the activity  (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#prmsn">permission</a></code>
attribute).
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="finish"></a><code>android:finishOnTaskLaunch</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not an existing instance of the activity should be shut down
(finished) whenever the user again launches its task (chooses the task on the
home screen) — "<code>true</code>" if it should be shut down, and "<code>false</code>"
if not. The default value is "<code>false</code>".

<p>
If this attribute and
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
are both "<code>true</code>", this attribute trumps the other.  The affinity of the
activity is ignored.  The activity is not re-parented, but destroyed.
</p>

</dd><dt><a name="hwaccel"></a><code>android:hardwareAccelerated</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not hardware-accelerated rendering should be enabled for this
Activity — "<code>true</code>" if it should be enabled, and "<code>false</code>" if
not. The default value is "<code>false</code>".


<p>Starting from Android 3.0, a hardware-accelerated OpenGL renderer is
available to applications, to improve performance for many common 2D graphics
operations. When the hardware-accelerated renderer is enabled, most operations
in Canvas, Paint, Xfermode, ColorFilter, Shader, and Camera are accelerated.
This results in smoother animations, smoother scrolling, and improved
responsiveness overall, even for applications that do not explicitly make use
the framework's OpenGL libraries. Because of the increased resources required to
enable hardware acceleration, your app will consume more RAM.</p>

<p>Note that not all of the OpenGL 2D operations are accelerated. If you enable
the hardware-accelerated renderer, test your application to ensure that it can
make use of the renderer without errors.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="icon"></a><code>android:icon</code></dt>
<dd>An icon representing the activity. The icon is displayed to users when
a representation of the activity is required on-screen.  For example, icons
for activities that initiate tasks are displayed in the launcher window.
The icon is often accompanied by a label (see the <a href="#label"><code>android:label</code></a> attribute).
<p></p>

<p>
This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing
the image definition.  If it is not set, the icon specified for the application
as a whole is used instead (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#icon">icon</a></code> attribute).
</p>

<p>
The activity's icon — whether set here or by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element — is also the default icon for all the activity's intent filters (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html">&lt;intent-filter&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html#icon">icon</a></code> attribute).
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="label"></a><code>android:label</code></dt>
<dd>A user-readable label for the activity.  The label is displayed on-screen
when the activity must be represented to the user. It's often displayed along
with the activity icon.

<p>
If this attribute is not set, the label set for the application as a whole is
used instead (see the <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#label">label</a></code> attribute).
</p>

<p>
The activity's label — whether set here or by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element — is also the
default label for all the activity's intent filters (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html">&lt;intent-filter&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element.html#label">label</a></code> attribute).
</p>

<p>
The label should be set as a reference to a string resource, so that
it can be localized like other strings in the user interface.
However, as a convenience while you're developing the application,
it can also be set as a raw string.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="lmode"></a><code>android:launchMode</code></dt>
<dd>An instruction on how the activity should be launched.  There are four modes
that work in conjunction with activity flags (<code>FLAG_ACTIVITY_*</code> constants)
in <code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html">Intent</a></code> objects to determine what should happen when
the activity is called upon to handle an intent. They are:<p></p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">"<code>standard</code>"
<br>"<code>singleTop</code>"
<br>"<code>singleTask</code>"
<br>"<code>singleInstance</code>"</p>

<p>
The default mode is "<code>standard</code>".
</p>

<p>
As shown in the table below, the modes fall into two main groups, with
"<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>" activities on one side, and
"<code>singleTask</code>" and "<code>singleInstance</code>" activities on the other.
An activity with the "<code>standard</code>" or "<code>singleTop</code>" launch mode
can be instantiated multiple times.  The instances can belong to any task
and can be located anywhere in the activity stack.  Typically, they're
launched into the task that called
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/content/Context.html#startActivity(android.content.Intent)">startActivity()</a></code></code>
(unless the Intent object contains a
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK">FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</a></code></code>
instruction, in which case a different task is chosen — see the
<a href="#aff">taskAffinity</a> attribute).
</p>

<p>
In contrast, "<code>singleTask</code>" and "<code>singleInstance</code>" activities
can only begin a task.  They are always at the root of the activity stack.
Moreover, the device can hold only one instance of the activity at a time
— only one such task.
</p>

<p>
The "<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>" modes differ from each other
in just one respect:  Every time there's a new intent for a "<code>standard</code>"
activity, a new instance of the class is created to respond to that intent.
Each instance handles a single intent.
Similarly, a new instance of a "<code>singleTop</code>" activity may also be
created to handle a new intent.  However, if the target task already has an
existing instance of the activity at the top of its stack, that instance
will receive the new intent (in an
<code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)">onNewIntent()</a></code> call);
a new instance is not created.
In other circumstances — for example, if an existing instance of the
"<code>singleTop</code>" activity is in the target task, but not at the top of
the stack, or if it's at the top of a stack, but not in the target task
— a new instance would be created and pushed on the stack.
</p>

<p>Similarly, if you
<a href="/training/implementing-navigation/ancestral.html">navigate
up</a> to an activity on the current stack, the behavior is determined by the
parent activity's launch mode. If the parent activity has launch mode <code>singleTop</code> (or the <code>up</code> intent contains <code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP">FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</a></code>), the parent is brought to the
top of the stack, and its state is preserved. The navigation intent is received
by the parent activity's <code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)">onNewIntent()</a></code>
method.  If the parent activity has launch mode <code>standard</code> (and the
<code>up</code> intent does not contain <code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP">FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</a></code>), the current activity and its
parent are both popped off the stack, and a new instance of the parent activity
is created to receive the navigation intent.
</p>


<p>
The "<code>singleTask</code>" and "<code>singleInstance</code>" modes also differ from
each other in only one respect:  A "<code>singleTask</code>" activity allows other
activities to be part of its task. It's always at the root of its task, but
other activities (necessarily "<code>standard</code>" and "<code>singleTop</code>"
activities) can be launched into that task.  A "<code>singleInstance</code>"
activity, on the other hand, permits no other activities to be part of its task.
It's the only activity in the task.  If it starts another activity, that
activity is assigned to a different task — as if <code>FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</code> was in the intent.

<p>As shown in the table above, <code>standard</code> is the default mode and is
appropriate for most types of activities. <code>SingleTop</code> is also a
common and useful launch mode for many types of activities. The other modes
— <code>singleTask</code> and <code>singleInstance</code> — are
<span style="color:red">not appropriate for most applications</span>,
since they result in an interaction model that is likely to be unfamiliar to
users and is very different from most other applications.

overview screen</a>. When this number of entries is reached, the system removes the least-recently
used instance from the overview screen. Valid values are 1 through 50 (25 on low memory devices);
zero is invalid. This must be an integer value, such as 50. The default value is 16.
</dd>

<dt><a name="multi"></a><code>android:multiprocess</code></dt>
<dd>Whether an instance of the activity can be launched into the process of the component
that started it — "<code>true</code>" if it can be, and "<code>false</code>" if not.
The default value is "<code>false</code>".

<p>
Normally, a new instance of an activity is launched into the process of the
application that defined it, so all instances of the activity run in the same
process.  However, if this flag is set to "<code>true</code>", instances of the
activity can run in multiple processes, allowing the system to create instances
wherever they are used (provided permissions allow it), something that is almost
never necessary or desirable.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="nm"></a><code>android:name</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the class that implements the activity, a subclass of
<code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activity</a></code>.  The attribute value should be a fully qualified
class name (such as, "<code>com.example.project.ExtracurricularActivity</code>").
However, as a shorthand, if the first character of the name is a period
(for example, "<code>.ExtracurricularActivity</code>"), it is appended to the
package name specified in the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html">&lt;manifest&gt;</a></code>
element.
<p>Once you publish your application, you <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/06/things-that-cannot-change.html">should not
change this name</a> (unless you've set <code><a href="#exported">android:exported</a>="false"</code>).</p>

<p>
There is no default.  The name must be specified.
</p></dd>

<!-- ##api level 3## -->
<dt><a name="nohist"></a><code>android:noHistory</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity should be removed from the activity stack and
finished (its <code><code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#finish()">finish()</a></code></code>
method called) when the user navigates away from it and it's no longer
visible on screen — "<code>true</code>" if it should be finished, and
"<code>false</code>" if not.  The default value is "<code>false</code>".

<p>
A value of "<code>true</code>" means that the activity will not leave a
historical trace.  It will not remain in the activity stack for the task,
so the user will not be able to return to it. In this case,
<code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onActivityResult(int, int, android.content.Intent)">onActivityResult()</a></code> is never called if you
start another activity for a result from this activity.
</p>

<p>
This attribute was introduced in API Level 3.
</p>
</dd>

<!-- api level 16 -->
<dt><a name="parent"></a><code>android:parentActivityName</code></dt>
<dd>The class name of the logical parent of the activity. The name here must match the class
  name given to the corresponding <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code> element's
  <a href="#nm"><code>android:name</code></a> attribute.

<p>The system reads this attribute to determine which activity should be started when
  the user presses the Up button in the action bar. The system can also use this information to
  synthesize a back stack of activities with <code><a href="/reference/android/app/TaskStackBuilder.html">TaskStackBuilder</a></code>.</p>

<p>To support API levels 4 - 16, you can also declare the parent activity with a <code>&lt;meta-data&gt;</code> element that specifies a value for <code>"android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"</code>.
For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><span class="tag">&lt;activity</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="atn">android:name</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">"com.example.app.ChildActivity"</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="atn">android:label</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">"@string/title_child_activity"</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="atn">android:parentActivityName</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">"com.example.myfirstapp.MainActivity"</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="tag">&gt;</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="com">&lt;!-- Parent activity meta-data to support API level 4+ --&gt;</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="tag">&lt;meta-data</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="atn">android:name</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">"android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="atn">android:value</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="atv">"com.example.app.MainActivity"</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="tag">/&gt;</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="tag">&lt;/activity&gt;</span></pre>

<p>
This attribute was introduced in API Level 16.
</p>
</dd>



<dt><a name="prmsn"></a><code>android:permission</code></dt>
<dd>The name of a permission that clients must have to launch the activity
or otherwise get it to respond to an intent.  If a caller of
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/content/Context.html#startActivity(android.content.Intent)">startActivity()</a></code></code> or
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#startActivityForResult(android.content.Intent, int)">startActivityForResult()</a></code></code>
has not been granted the specified permission, its intent will not be
delivered to the activity.

<p>
If this attribute is not set, the permission set by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#prmsn">permission</a></code>
attribute applies to the activity.  If neither attribute is set, the activity is
not protected by a permission.
</p>

<p>
For more information on permissions, see the
<a href="/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html#sectperm">Permissions</a>
section in the introduction and another document,
<a href="/guide/topics/security/security.html">Security and
Permissions</a>.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="proc"></a><code>android:process</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the process in which the activity should run. Normally, all components of an
application run in a default process name created for the application and you do
not need to use this attribute. But if necessary, you can override the default process
name with this attribute, allowing you to spread your app components across
multiple processes.

<p>
If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new
process, private to the application, is created when it's needed and
the activity runs in that process.
If the process name begins with a lowercase character, the activity will run
in a global process of that name, provided that it has permission to do so.
This allows components in different applications to share a process, reducing
resource usage.
</p>

<p>The <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#proc">process</a></code>
attribute can set a different default process name for all components.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="relinquish"></a><code>android:relinquishTaskIdentity</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity relinquishes its task identifiers to an activity above it in the
task stack. A task whose root activity has this attribute set to "<code>true</code>" replaces the base
Intent with that of the next activity in the task. If the next activity also has this attribute set
to "<code>true</code>" then it will yield the base Intent to any activity that it launches in the same
task. This continues for each activity until an activity is encountered which has this attribute set
to "<code>false</code>". The default value is "<code>false</code>".

<p>This attribute set to "<code>true</code>" also permits the activity's use of the
<code><a href="/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.TaskDescription.html">ActivityManager.TaskDescription</a></code> to change labels, colors
and icons in the <a href="/guide/components/recents.html">overview screen</a>.</p>
</dd>


<dt><a name="screen"></a><code>android:screenOrientation</code></dt>
<dd>The orientation of the activity's display on the device.

<p>The value can be any one of the following strings:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
   <td>"<code>unspecified</code>"</td>
   <td>The default value.  The system chooses the orientation.  The policy it
       uses, and therefore the choices made in specific contexts, may differ
       from device to device.</td>

   <td>"<code>behind</code>"</td>
   <td>The same orientation as the activity that's immediately beneath it in
       the activity stack.</td>

   <td>"<code>landscape</code>"</td>
   <td>Landscape orientation (the display is wider than it is tall).</td>

   <td>"<code>portrait</code>"</td>
   <td>Portrait orientation (the display is taller than it is wide).</td>

   <td>"<code>reverseLandscape</code>"</td>
   <td>Landscape orientation in the opposite direction from normal landscape.

   <td>Portrait orientation, but can be either normal or reverse portrait based on the device
sensor.
<em>Added in API level 9.</em></td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"<code>userLandscape</code>"</td>
   <td>Landscape orientation, but can be either normal or reverse landscape based on the device
sensor and the user's sensor preference. If the user has locked sensor-based rotation, this behaves
the same as <code>landscape</code>, otherwise it behaves the same as <code>sensorLandscape</code>.
<em>Added in API level 18.</em></td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"<code>userPortrait</code>"</td>
   <td>Portrait orientation, but can be either normal or reverse portrait based on the device

<em>Added in API level 18.</em></td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"<code>sensor</code>"</td>
   <td>The orientation is determined by the device orientation sensor.  The orientation of the

device. Some devices, though, will not rotate to all four possible orientations, by default. To
allow all four orientations, use <code>"fullSensor"</code>.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"<code>fullSensor</code>"</td>
   <td>The orientation is determined by the device orientation sensor for any of the 4 orientations.
This is similar to <code>"sensor"</code> except this allows any of the 4 possible screen orientations,
regardless of what the device will normally do (for example, some devices won't normally use reverse
portrait or reverse landscape, but this enables those). <em>Added in API level 9.</em></td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"<code>nosensor</code>"</td>
   <td>The orientation is determined without reference to a physical orientation sensor.  The sensor
is ignored, so the display will not rotate based on how the user moves the device.  Except for this
distinction, the system chooses the orientation using the same policy as for the "<code>unspecified</code>" setting.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"<code>user</code>"</td>
   <td>The user's current preferred orientation.</td>
</tr><tr>
   <td>"<code>fullUser</code>"</td>
   <td>If the user has locked sensor-based rotation, this behaves the same as <code>user</code>,

</tbody></table>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you declare one of the landscape or portrait values,
it is considered a hard requirement for the orientation in which the activity runs. As such,
the value you declare enables filtering by services such as Google Play so your application is
available only to devices that support the orientation required by your activities. For
example, if you declare either <code>"landscape"</code>, <code>"reverseLandscape"</code>, or
<code>"sensorLandscape"</code>, then your application will be available only to devices that support
landscape orientation. However, you should also explicitly declare that
your application requires either portrait or landscape orientation with the <a href="/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html"><code>&lt;uses-feature&gt;</code></a>
element. For example, <code>&lt;uses-feature
android:name="android.hardware.screen.portrait"/&gt;</code>. This is purely a filtering behavior
provided by Google Play (and other services that support it) and the platform itself does not
control whether your app can be installed when a device supports only certain orientations.</p>

</dd>

<dt><a name="state"></a><code>android:stateNotNeeded</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not the activity can be killed and successfully restarted
without having saved its state — "<code>true</code>" if it can be restarted
without reference to its previous state, and "<code>false</code>" if its previous
state is required.  The default value is "<code>false</code>".

<p>
Normally, before an activity is temporarily shut down to save resources, its
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)">onSaveInstanceState()</a></code></code>
method is called.  This method stores the current state of the activity in a
<code><a href="/reference/android/os/Bundle.html">Bundle</a></code> object, which is then passed to
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)">onCreate()</a></code></code> when the activity
is restarted.  If this attribute is set to "<code>true</code>",
<code>onSaveInstanceState()</code> may not be called and <code>onCreate()</code> will
be passed <code>null</code> instead of the Bundle — just as it was when the
activity started for the first time.
</p>

<p>
A "<code>true</code>" setting ensures that the activity can be restarted in the
absence of retained state.  For example, the activity that displays the
home screen uses this setting to make sure that it does not get removed if it
crashes for some reason.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="aff"></a><code>android:taskAffinity</code></dt>
<dd>The task that the activity has an affinity for.  Activities with
the same affinity conceptually belong to the same task (to the same
"application" from the user's perspective).  The affinity of a task
is determined by the affinity of its root activity.

<p>
The affinity determines two things — the task that the activity is re-parented
to (see the <code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#reparent">allowTaskReparenting</a></code>
attribute) and the task that will house the activity when it is launched
with the <code><code><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK">FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</a></code></code>
flag.
</p>

<p>
By default, all activities in an application have the same affinity.  You
can set this attribute to group them differently, and even place
activities defined in different applications within the same task.  To
specify that the activity does not have an affinity for any task, set
it to an empty string.

</p><p>
If this attribute is not set, the activity inherits the affinity set
for the application (see the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#aff">taskAffinity</a></code>
attribute).  The name of the default affinity for an application is
the package name set by the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html">&lt;manifest&gt;</a></code>
element.
</p>

</dd><dt><a name="theme"></a><code>android:theme</code></dt>
<dd>A reference to a style resource defining an overall theme for the activity.
This automatically sets the activity's context to use this theme (see
<code><code><a href="/reference/android/content/Context.html#setTheme(int)">setTheme()</a></code></code>, and may also
cause "starting" animations prior to the activity being launched (to better
match what the activity actually looks like).

<p>
If this attribute is not set, the activity inherits the theme set for the
application as a whole — from the
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html">&lt;application&gt;</a></code>
element's
<code><a href="/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#theme">theme</a></code>
attribute.  If that attribute is also not set, the default system theme is used. For more
information, see the <a href="/guide/topics/ui/themes.html">Styles and Themes</a> developer guide.

split into the top navigation section and the bottom bar for action items. This ensures a reasonable
amount of space is made available not only for the action items, but also for navigation and title
elements at the top. Menu items are not split across the two bars; they always appear
together.</td></tr>

<dt><a name="wsoft"></a><code>android:windowSoftInputMode</code></dt>
<dd>How the main window of the activity interacts with the window containing
the on-screen soft keyboard.  The setting for this attribute affects two
things:

<ul>
<li>The state of the soft keyboard — whether it is hidden or visible
— when the activity becomes the focus of user attention.</li>

<li>The adjustment made to the activity's main window — whether it is
resized smaller to make room for the soft keyboard or whether its contents
pan to make the current focus visible when part of the window is covered by
the soft keyboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The setting must be one of the values listed in the following table, or a
combination of one "<code>state...</code>" value plus one "<code>adjust...</code>"
value.  Setting multiple values in either group — multiple
"<code>state...</code>" values, for example — has undefined results.
Individual values are separated by a vertical bar (<code>|</code>).  For example:
