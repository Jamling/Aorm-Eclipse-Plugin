<dl class="attr">
<dt><a name="enabled"></a><code>android:enabled</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not the service can be instantiated by the system — 
"<code>true</code>" if it can be, and "<code>false</code>" if not.  The default value 
is "<code>true</code>".

<p>
The <code><a href="#">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element has its own 
<code><a href="#">enabled</a></code> attribute that applies to all 
application components, including services.  The 
<code><a href="#">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> and <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> 
attributes must both be "<code>true</code>" (as they both
are by default) for the service to be enabled.  If either is 
"<code>false</code>", the service is disabled; it cannot be instantiated.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="exported"></a><code>android:exported</code></dt>
<dd>Whether or not components of other applications can invoke 
the service or interact with it — "<code>true</code>" if they can, and 
"<code>false</code>" if not.  When the value is "<code>false</code>", only 
components of the same application or applications 
with the same user ID can start the service or bind to it.

<p>
The default value depends on whether the service contains intent filters.  The 
absence of any filters means that it can be invoked only by specifying 
its exact class name.  This implies that the service is intended only for 
application-internal use (since others would not know the class name).  So in 
this case, the default value is "<code>false</code>".
On the other hand, the presence of at least one filter implies that the service 
is intended for external use, so the default value is "<code>true</code>".
</p>

<p>
This attribute is not the only way to limit the exposure of a service to other
applications.  You can also use a permission to limit the external entities that 
can interact with the service (see the <code><a href="#">permission</a></code> 
attribute).
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="icon"></a><code>android:icon</code></dt>
<dd>An icon representing the service.  This attribute must be set as a 
reference to a drawable resource containing the image definition.  
If it is not set, the icon specified for the application 
as a whole is used instead (see the <code><a href="#">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> 
element's <code><a href="#">icon</a></code> attribute).
<p></p>

<p>
The service's icon — whether set here or by the 
<code><a href="#">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element — is also the 
default icon for all the service's intent filters (see the 
<code><a href="#">&lt;intent-filter&gt;</a></code> element's 
<code><a href="#">icon</a></code> attribute).
</p></dd> 

<dt><a name="isolated"></a><code>android:isolatedProcess</code></dt>
<dd>If set to true, this service will run under a special process that is isolated from the
  rest of the system and has no permissions of its own.
  The only communication with it is through the Service API 
  (binding and starting).</dd>

<dt><a name="label"></a><code>android:label</code></dt>
<dd>A name for the service that can be displayed to users.  
If this attribute is not set, the label set for the application as a whole is 
used instead (see the <code><a href="#">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element's 
<code><a href="#">label</a></code> attribute).

<p>
The service's label — whether set here or by the 
<code><a href="#">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element — is also the 
default label for all the service's intent filters (see the 
<code><a href="#">&lt;intent-filter&gt;</a></code> element's 
<code><a href="#">label</a></code> attribute). 
</p>

<p>
The label should be set as a reference to a string resource, so that
it can be localized like other strings in the user interface.  
However, as a convenience while you're developing the application, 
it can also be set as a raw string.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="nm"></a><code>android:name</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the <code><a href="#">Service</a></code> subclass that implements 
the service.  This should be a fully qualified class name (such as, 
"<code>com.example.project.RoomService</code>").  However, as a shorthand, if 
the first character of the name is a period (for example, "<code>.RoomService</code>"),
it is appended to the package name specified in the 
<code><a href="#">&lt;manifest&gt;</a></code> element.  

<p>Once you publish your application, you <a href="#">should not
change this name</a> (unless you've set <code><a href="#">android:exported</a>="false"</code>).</p>

<p>
There is no default.  The name must be specified.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="prmsn"></a><code>android:permission</code></dt>
<dd>The name of a permission that that an entity must have in order to 
launch the service or bind to it.  If a caller of 
<code><code><a href="#">startService()</a></code></code>,
<code><code><a href="#">bindService()</a></code></code>, or
<code><code><a href="#">stopService()</a></code></code>,
has not been granted this permission, the method will not work and the
Intent object will not be delivered to the service.

<p>
If this attribute is not set, the permission set by the 
<code><a href="#">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element's
<code><a href="#">permission</a></code> 
attribute applies to the service.  If neither attribute is set, the service is
not protected by a permission.
</p>

<p>
For more information on permissions, see the 
<a href="#">Permissions</a> 
section in the introduction and a separate document, 
<a href="#">Security and Permissions</a>.
</p></dd>

<dt><a name="proc"></a><code>android:process</code></dt>
<dd>The name of the process where the service is to run.  Normally, 
all components of an application run in the default process created for the 
application.  It has the same name as the application package.  The 
<code><a href="#">&lt;application&gt;</a></code> element's 
<code><a href="#">process</a></code> 
attribute can set a different 
default for all components.  But component can override the default
with its own <code>process</code> attribute, allowing you to spread your 
application across multiple processes.

<p>
If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new 
process, private to the application, is created when it's needed and 
the service runs in that process.
If the process name begins with a lowercase character, the service will run 
in a global process of that name, provided that it has permission to do so.
This allows components in different applications to share a process, reducing 
resource usage.
